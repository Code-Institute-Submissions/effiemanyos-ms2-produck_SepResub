## **Interactive Front-End Development Milestone Project 2**

### **Project Overview**

This project consists of a **interactive front-end platform** built to help **aspiring PMs** break into Product Management despite having a non-technical background, by providing them with professionally selected external resources and **[Produck](https://effiemanyos.github.io/ms2-produck/)**'s productivity tools so that they can land their first PM job and properly excel in the role. From a business perspective, this project's main purpose is to **strategically build a strong community of product professionals within Ireland, a way to network and build relationships with international industry experts, promote and sell Produck's membership, workshops, and online courses, become an important Irish thought leader**. 

This is the **second milestone project** in obtaining a **[Full-Stack Web Development](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/) University-Rated Professional Diploma** from **[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)**. Regarding the technologies used, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** were required for this project (**jQuery**, **jQuery UI**, **Bootstrap**, and **APIs** were optional); however, as observed, other technologies were also slightly used to improve the overall quality and user experience.

# **UX DESIGN**  

## **Strategy Plane** 
____

### **Target Audience**
- Recent Graduates (Tech/Non-Tech Background)
- Product Enthusiasts (Curious & Passionate)
- Aspiring Product Managers
- Entry-Level Product Managers
- APMs (Associate Product Managers)
- Non-Tech Background Professionals
- Entrepreneurs (Founders & Co-Founders)
- Professionals Transitioning Into PM

**Produck** is targeting professionals passionate about Technology, Products, Innovation; people constantly looking to solve customers' pain-points and struggles by leveraging the use of technology.

**Targeted Countries:** Ireland & UK (Main Markets)

**Targeted Age:** Not Specified

All under the constraints of a **tight/no budget to spend on expensive bootcamps** (e.g. Product School or Kellogg School of Management).

### **User Needs**

These are some crucial **user pain points or struggles** worth mentioning:

1. **Lack of Trust** | Users do not know how to differentiate between high-quality content and poor or fake PM content on the internet, as they do not have previus professional experience in the field.
2. **Quantity Over Quality** | There is too much information all over the internet, but most sources share vague, superficial or inaccurate content about Product Management. 
3. **Overwhelming & Exhausting** | It is overwhelming and exhausting for users to navigate through all those online resources (too many options to choose from), while also trying to find the right information from the right source without having to consult friends or colleagues.
4. **Lack of Time** | There is too much going on in users' lives at the moment (esp. during the global pandemic) that they do not have the time to search for the information themselves because it is proven that it takes a lot of time to do the research every time.
5. **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)** | Users have also shared during the user research that they constantly feel that they are missing out on great tips and valuable content from high-quality resources (esp. from Fortune 100 companies, book authors, mentors, industry experts).
6. **Lack of Official Studies** | There is a lack of official Product Management studies offered by universities and colleges. Users are looking for cost-effective bootcamps, workshops, cohorts, mentors, and online courses to learn more about this relatively new field in the tech industry.

### **Business Opportunity**

- Growth demand for Product Managers
- Golden age of Product Management 
- Tech gap in the Irish market
- Boom in the tech industry worldwide
- Product economy is increasing

### **What Are Users Looking For?**

Users are looking for **ONE THING** (their main goal):
- **Break Into Product Management**, which means getting their first PM role and start their PM career from there!

### **User Goals**

*Produck's Services & User Goals From Their POV:*
- Use the mentoring and coaching programmes to break into Product Managemen, which means getting my first PM role in a tech company.
- Access the up-to-date directory of the best Product Management online resources (professionally selected by Produck) and thought leaders (international industry experts) to learn from the best.
- Attend to Produck's networking events to meet other aspiring Product Managers, as well as people already in the industry to learn from their past experiences.
- Join Produck's PM community to share my passion and strong interest for Product Management and Technology with other product enthusiasts.
- Attend Produck's group workshops and take their online courses to develop key PM skills and gain some practical knowledge by working on small side projects, not just by reading, listening, or watching content.
- Stay up-to-date with bite-sized news and information on the latest trends, methods, frameworkds, tools, products, technology by clicking on the website's Social Media icons to follow Produck's social channels.
- Constantly check Produck's job board with entry-level PM roles based in Ireland (or remote worldwide) to start applying to the ones I like the most.(**)
- Watch Produck's weekly live interviews with Q&As at the end to learn from other PMs working at Fortune 100 companies in Ireland or other countries.
- Locate the best and most useful PM mock interviews recommended by Produck to ace mine and get my dream job in Product Management.

*Important Features:*
- Use the Produck's **productivity web-based applications** to help me build a reading habit to learn as much as possible from book authors, which are experts in the field(*)
- Use the **tobuylist web-based application** to keep track of the books I am planning to buy within the next six months and be mindful of the budget I will be allocating or investing in this. 
- Use the **toreadlist web-based application**
- Use the **booknotes web-based application**
- Use the **toratelist web-based application**
- Use the **bookmarks web-based application** to save my favourite online sources of information about Product Management taken from Produck's resources directory.








>(*) Currently, books are one of the most reliable (cost-effective) source of information about Product Management. This is the main reason why Produck's owner has decided to create various web-based applications using Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and Local Storage to help Produck users set their own objectives and track their reading milestones in the same platform where they can also learn more about Product Management through other carefully selected external resources.          
(**) This is not part of the MVP features but Produck will do have a job board.

All these are **assumptions** from insights gathered during previus user research. However, they still need to be validated once the MVP is launched.

**In summary, the users' main goals are the following:**
- Get my first PM role
- Learn from the best
- Network with other PMs
- Save time and money
- Build relationships
- Be part of a community
- Get involved in Ireland
- Develop key PM skills
- Gain PM experience
- Always be up-to-date

### **Business Goals**
Site Owner's Goals:
- Create an active Irish Product Management community
- Incentivate women based in Ireland to pursue tech roles
- Increase Produck's client base for mentoring & training
- Build an audience of passionate PMs
- Help aspiring PMs land their first PM role
- Build brand awareness in Ireland & UK
- Expand networking opportunities
- Connect with industry experts & leaders
- Become thought leaders in Ireland & UK

## **Surface Plane** 
____

### **Typography**

Only one font was used for this project.

- **[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins&preview.text_type=custom)**, designed by Indian Type Foundry, Jonny Pinhorn, for all paragraphs.

**Font Styling:**

The following styling has been used for consistency and alignment throughout the entire website:
- **Titles (h1, h2):** 

```CSS
/* Main Titles Styling */
.titles {
    font-family: Neucha, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 40px;
    letter-spacing: 4px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### **Color Scheme**

According to an article on **[The Science of Colour Persuasion](https://idealogicbrandlab.com/color-persuasion/)** by **IDealogic® Brand Lab**:

Colour establishes **brand recognition** amongst consumers, therefore it is crucial that the same colours are always used across all channels, such as website, social media, advertising, product packaging, merchandising, etc.

The following are the colours used for this project:

![the website and brand colour palette](assets/images/color-scheme.png "the website and brand colour palette")

**Primary Colours:**
> - **Purple** → Associated with **trust, loyalty, dependability, logic, security, serenity, and stimulates productivity**.
> - **Black** → Associated with **sophistication, luxury, security, power, elegance, authority, and substance**.
> - **Green** → Associated with **health, growth, freshness, prosperity, hope, encourages balance and harmony**.
> - **White** → Associated with **innocence, purity, cleanliness, and simplistic**.

### **Logo Variations**

![logo variations of the brand](assets/images/logo-variations.png "logo variations of the brand") 

### **Imagery**

The illustration from the 'Background' section was taken from **[UnDraw](https://undraw.co/)** to improve the UX. The illustration has been edited to match the website and brand colours (branded).

Professional photographies from **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)** have been used for the 'Hero Image', 'About Produck' and 'About PM' sections of the website. 

When ready, professional photos and videos will be added to the website in various sections. Some of the images and videos will come from:
- Live Workshops
- Networking Events
- Online Webinars
- PM Conferences
- Collaborations
- Community Activities

At the moment, the imagery used is for academic purposes only in order to meet the project deadline. These images will be replaced before the launch of the website.
